    <h4>Species search</h4>

    <p>To find information on a particular species, users should first select which
    Convention (&#34;CITES&#34;or &#34;CMS&#34;) they seek information on (the default is CITES). This
    will filter the data based on the taxonomy and species that are listed under that 
    Convention. Then, users can search for a species or higher taxon using the search
    field. An additional &#34;locations&#34; filter can also be applied if users are only
    interested in a species or group of species that occur in a particular country,
    territory or region.</p>

    <p>Once on a species page, the database includes the following information for each
    species:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>LEGAL</strong></li>

        <ul>
          <li>CITES: details of CITES Appendix listings, quotas and suspensions, as
          well as EU Annexes and EU decisions.</li>

          <li>CMS: details of the CMS Appendix listing, as well as listings in other
          CMS Family Agreements and MoUs.</li>
        </ul>

      <li><strong>NAMES</strong></li>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Synonyms and common names</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Geographic distribution at the country and territory level
          (where available)</li>
        </ul>

      <li><strong>REFERENCES</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li> CITES Standard reference or CMS reference, where applicable, or
          other scientific literature references that relate to the species name or the
          distribution.</li>

    </ul>
