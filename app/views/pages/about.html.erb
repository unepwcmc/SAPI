    <p>Species+, developed by UNEP-WCMC and the CITES Secretariat, is a website
    designed to assist Parties with implementing CITES, CMS and other multilateral
    environmental agreements (MEAs). Species+ provides a centralised portal for 
    accessing key information on species of global concern.</p>

    <p>In particular, Species+ contains information on all species that are listed in the
    Appendices of CITES and CMS, as well as other CMS Family listings and species
    included in the Annexes to the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations.</p>

  <div class="column-one">
    <h4>Species search</h4>

    <p>To find information on a particular species, users should first select which
    Convention (&#34;CITES&#34; or &#34;CMS&#34;) they seek information on (the default is CITES). This
    will filter the data based on the taxonomy and species that are listed under that
    Convention. Then, users can search for a species or higher taxon using the search
    field. An additional &#34;locations&#34; filter can also be applied if users are only
    interested in a species or group of species that occur in a particular country,
    territory or region.</p>

    <p>Once on a species page, the database includes the following information for each
    species:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>LEGAL</strong></li>

        <ul>
          <li>CITES: details of CITES Appendix listings, quotas and suspensions, as
          well as EU Annexes and EU decisions.</li>

          <li>CMS: details of the CMS Appendix listing, as well as listings in other
          CMS Family Agreements and MoUs.</li>
        </ul>

      <li><strong>NAMES</strong></li>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Synonyms and common names.</li>
        </ul>

      <li><strong>DISTRIBUTION</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Geographic distribution at the country and territory level
          (where available).</li>
        </ul>

      <li><strong>REFERENCES</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li> CITES Standard reference or CMS reference, where applicable, or
          other scientific literature references that relate to the species name or the
          distribution.</li>
        </ul>
        
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note on Legal information:</strong> Species+ allows users to view historic legal
    information by clicking on &#34;Show History&#34;. Where legal information applies to
    subspecies or synonyms, this information will appear on the page for the
    corresponding accepted species name.</p>
