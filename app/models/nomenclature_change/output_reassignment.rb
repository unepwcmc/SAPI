# Represents a reassignment of taxon concept associations, which may be
# a side effect of a nomenclature change.
# For example, if the change involves swapping an accepted name and a synonym,
# the former accepted name's synonyms, distribution, legislation etc. will be
# assigned to the former synonym.
# The table uses an STI mechanism to differentiate between different types of
# associations.
# A polymorphic association is in place that links this object to the entitity
# that gets reassigned.
# For example the reassignable_type might be 'ListingChange'
