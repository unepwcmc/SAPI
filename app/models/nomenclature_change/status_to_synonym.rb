# A status change to S needs to have at least one output and at most two
# The case where there are 2 is as follows:
# N taxon t1 (input) downgraded to synonym t1 (output1),
# with any associations transferred to accepted taxon t2 (output2)

# As a rule of thumb, if there are 2 outputs that means there are reassignments
# involved between the input and one of the outputs.
