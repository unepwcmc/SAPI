    -- This query took like half a day to get right, so maybe it deserves a comment.
    -- It uses a sql procedure (ary_higher_or_equal_ranks_names) to return all ranks above
    -- the current taxon concept and then from those ranks get at actual ancestor ids.
    -- The reason for doing it that way is to make use of ancestor data which we already store
    -- for every taxon concept in columns named 'name_of_rank_id'.
    -- We also want to know the tree distance between the current taxon concept and any
    -- of its ancestors.
    -- So we call the higher_or_equal_ranks_names procedure for every taxon concept,
    -- and the only way to parametrise it correctly is to call it in the select clause.
    -- Because it returns an array of ranks, and what we want is a set of (taxon concept, ancestor, distance),
    -- we then go through the UNNEST thing in order to arrive at separate rows per ancestor.
    -- In order to know the distance it is enough to know the index of the ancestor in the originally
    -- returned array, because it is already sorted accordingly. That's what GENERATE_SUBSCRIPTS does.
    -- Quite surprisingly, this worked.
