\noindent Annotations are used in the CITES Appendices to indicate which population, parts or derivatives are concerned by the listing or to clarify its scope. The meaning of these annotations has changed over the years. Below is a historical summary of these meanings, with the date when they became valid and the meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP) at which they were adopted. For instance, annotation "\#1" originally simply designated "roots", while it now designates:

\begin{adjustwidth}{1.5cm}{}
All parts and derivatives, except:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item seeds, spores and pollen (including pollinia);
\item seedling or tissue cultures obtained in vitro, in solid or liquid media, transported in sterile containers;
\item cut flowers of artificially propagated plants; and
\item fruits, and parts and derivatives thereof, of artificially propagated plants of the genus \textit{Vanilla}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{adjustwidth}
\vspace{15pt}

\noindent The validity dates indicated in the table below refer to the dates of entry into effect of new Appendices I and II, that is 90 days after each meeting of the Conference of Parties (CoP). Since inclusions in Appendix III may be made at any time, however, annotations specific to species included in that Appendix may have come into force later than 90 days after the CoP they appear under. For instance, annotation \#13 listed under the CoP15 section below (valid from 23 June 2010) is linked to the inclusion of a species in Appendix III that entered into force on 14 October 2010. Such cases are very rare and, in any case, the date of entry into force of any annotation is indicated in the History of CITES Listings next to the species it applies to.
