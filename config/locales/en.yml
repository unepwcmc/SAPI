        <p>
          The CITES Identification Manual is a collection of data sheets designed to help identify various species of fauna and flora with drawings, photographs, maps and concise descriptions. The manual&apos;s sheets were published over a 29 year period, from 1980–2009. All sheets are provided as originally published, and, as such, no warranty of any kind is given as to the completeness or accuracy of their content. Identification materials are not available for every species, and may be absent  particularly for species listed in the CITES Appendices after 2009.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users should note that the CITES listing and taxonomy of taxa described in the materials may have changed since the materials were first published. For current CITES nomenclature and listing information, please refer to the main Checklist of CITES Species site (and dedicated downloads for listings/names) and Species+.
        </p>
        <p>
          The manual contains materials available in the three working languages of the Convention (English, French and Spanish), but materials in French and Spanish are available for fewer taxa. Materials are provided in the language specified where possible, but where materials are not available in French and Spanish, they are instead provided in English.
