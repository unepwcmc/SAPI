    # EPIPE is probably due to a client disconnecting or navigating away before
    # a download is complete. The errors typically come from or via Passenger's
    # `phusion_passenger/utils/unseekable_socket.rb`, and are accompanied by the
    # message `Broken pipe - writev()`. There's a (possibly) related issue:
